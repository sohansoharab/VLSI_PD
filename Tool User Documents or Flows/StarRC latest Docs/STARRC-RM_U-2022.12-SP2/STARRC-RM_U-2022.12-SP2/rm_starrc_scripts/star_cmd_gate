***********	SETUP	  ********** 

* Specify block name for parasitic extraction
BLOCK:  <block_name>

* Provide the input NDM design database 
NDM_DATABASE:  <ndm_design_library>


* Specify nxtgrd file which consists of capacitance models
TCAD_GRD_FILE:  <nxtgrd_file>

* Provide the mapping file in which design layers mapped to process layers 
MAPPING_FILE:  <mapping_file>

* Reduction setting fro STA Analysis
REDUCTION: NO_EXTRA_LOOPS 

* Use '*' to extract all signal nets in the design. Otherwise, provide the net names to be extracted separated by a space. Wildcards '?' and '!' are accepted for net names
NETS: *

* Use 'RC' to perform resistance and capacitance extraction on the nets
EXTRACTION: RC 

* Provide operating temperature in degree celsius at which extraction is performed
OPERATING_TEMPERATURE: <temperature_in_celsius> 

* Enable Double Patterning Technology
DPT: YES 

***********     FLOW SELECTION       **********

* Choose maximum of 2 cores for designs less than 100k nets, 4 to 6 cores for designs around 1Million nets and 8 to 16 cores for designs around 10Million nets
NUM_CORES: 

* Provide settings to distribute StarRC job on Gridwire or LSF. Use Command Reference manual for reference
STARRC_DP_STRING: 
* Simultaneous Multicorner Extraction is supported with Distributed Processing and Rapid3D extractions
* Temperature sensitivity extraction is now integrated into SMC
* Define all corners at the project level in the following syntax in corners.smc file:
*   CORNER_NAME: CWorst_TWC
*   TCAD_GRD_FILE: CWorst.nxtgrd
*   OPERATING_TEMPERATURE: TWC
*   CORNER_NAME: CTypical_TTP
*   TCAD_GRD_FILE: CTypical.nxtgrd
*   OPERATING_TEMPERATURE: TTP
*   CORNER_NAME: CBest_TBC
*   TCAD_GRD_FILE: CBest.nxtgrd
*   OPERATING_TEMPERATURE: TBC
* Provide the defined corners.smc file
CORNERS_FILE: corners.smc
DENSITY_BASED_THICKNESS: YES
* Put DENSITY_OUTSIDE_BLOCK: density_value in corners.smc file
* For details on DENISTY_OUTSIDE_BLOCK refer to the User Guide
* List all corners to be extracted separated by a space
SELECTED_CORNERS: CWorst_TWC CTypical_TTP CBest_TBC
* Enable the SMC feature
SIMULTANEOUS_MULTI_CORNER: YES


***********     SKIPPING ALL CELLS **********

SKIP_CELLS: * 


#

***********     FILL HANDLING      **********

* Provide fills containing design view if it exists in a separate design view
NDM_DESIGN_VIEW : <FillOnlyView>

* Provide the setting how the metal fill needs to be treated, FLOATING or GROUNDED
METAL_FILL_POLYGON_HANDLING:  <FLOATING | GROUNDED>


***********     ENHANCED SHORTS REPORTING  **********

* Enabling the expansion of different types of shorts detection and reporting
* May encounter performance impact due to the enabling of enhanced shorts reporting
* The details are reported in shorts_all.sum in star directory

ENHANCED_SHORT_REPORTING: COMPLETE

* Default number of shorts to be reported is 1000
* Can be changed to a different number if needed

SHORTS_LIMIT: <no_of_shorts>


***********     DEBUG DISPLAY SETUP IN NDM DB  **********

* Provides the visualization setup of extracted nets in a prior run in NDM formatted DB
* Step 1: After running StarRC, create a debug command file, star_debug_cmd, for viewing the layout 
* of net1, net2, and net3 with the following three StarRC commands:
*  DEBUG_NDM_DATABASE: NDM_Debug
*  *Make sure the STAR_DIRECTORY is the same as the previous run's
*  STAR_DIRECTORY: star
*  NETS: net1 net2 net3
*
* Step 2: Invoke StarRC tool with the following command
*  StarXtract -Display star_debug_cmd
*
* Step 3: Open the created NDM DB, NDM_Debug, in IC Compiler II
* for viewing to aid in one's debug


***********     PARASITIC OUTPUT       **********

COUPLE_TO_GROUND: NO 

COUPLING_ABS_THRESHOLD: 1e-15
COUPLING_REL_THRESHOLD: 0.01
REDUCTION_MAX_DELAY_ERROR: 1e-14


NETLIST_FORMAT: SPEF 

* Provide the name of a file to which output parasitic netlist is written
NETLIST_FILE: ./results/<netlist_file>.spef 


* Provide the name of a summary file to which runtime and memory usage is written
SUMMARY_FILE: ./results/<summary_file>.star_sum 

* Provide the working directory name to which StarRC internal information is written in binary
STAR_DIRECTORY: ./<star_directory>
