A reference methodology provides a set of reference scripts that serve as a good
starting point for running a tool. These scripts are not designed to run in their
current form. You should use them as a reference and adapt them for use in your
design environment.

The PrimeTime Reference Methodology includes options for running the PrimeTime,
PrimeTime SI, PrimeTime ADV, PrimeTime GCA, and PrimeTime PX tools.
Note: Additional licenses are required when running the add-on tools.

The PrimeTime Reference Methodology also includes options for using multivoltage
scaling libraries and IEEE 1801 mode, options for running power analysis, and a link
to TetraMAX. IEEE 1801 is also known as the Unified Power Format (UPF).

Instructions for using the PrimeTime Reference Methodology
==========================================================

1. Copy the reference methodology files to a new location.

2. Edit common_setup.tcl to set the design name, search path, and library
   information for your design.

3. Edit pt_setup.tcl to further customize your PrimeTime setup.

   This file is designed to work automatically with the values provided
   in the common_setup.tcl file.

4. Edit pt_scripts/pt.tcl to customize the steps that you want to perform in your
   static timing analysis.

   Read the script carefully, note the comments, and choose which steps you want
   to include in your analysis. You can also change the file names to support your
   design environment. This is a reference example. It requires modification to
   work with your design.

5. Run your static timing analysis by using the appropriate command for the flow
   that you have selected in RMgen.

   For a standard reference methodology flow, run the tool from the directory
   above the rm_setup directory.

   To run the generic flow, enter one of the following commands:

   o  For the standard reference methodology flow, enter

      % pt_shell -f rm_pt_scripts/pt.tcl | tee pt.log

   To run the DMSA flow, enter one of the following commands:

   o  For the standard reference methodology flow, enter

      % pt_shell -multi -f rm_pt_scripts/dmsa.tcl | tee dmsalog

Output files from PrimeTime Reference Methodology
=================================================

For both the generic and DMSA flows, the ${REPORTS} directory defined
in pt_setup.tcl contains reports from the static timing analysis run.

For the DMSA flow, you should inspect the following subdirectory:

Each mode or corner (scenario) of a DMSA run has a log file located at

   <current_working_directory>/work/scenario/out.log

Analyze the output files generated by the PrimeTime Reference Methodology
scripts to resolve issues with the setup (check_timing -verbose and report_clock)
and timing violations (report_timing and report_constraints).
