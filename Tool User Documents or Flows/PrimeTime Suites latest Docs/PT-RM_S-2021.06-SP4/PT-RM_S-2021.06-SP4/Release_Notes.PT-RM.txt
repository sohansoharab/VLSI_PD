O-2018.06-SP2
=============
PrimeTime Reference Methodology version O-2018.06-SP2 provides the following
new features, enhancements, and changes:

* The interactive multi-scenario analysis (IMSA)

  The interactive multi-scenario analysis (IMSA) flow lets you load and simultaneously debug multiple collections of
  timing paths from different worker sessions.

* Cover through reporting
  get_timing_paths and report_timing commands are enhanced with a new option, -cover_through through_list,
  which collects the single worst violating path through each of the objects specified in a list.

* Moment POCV
  POCV now take Moment-based LVF libraries for analysis.

* Power-Analysis-driven Power Recovery
  The power-analysis-driven power recovery in PrimeTime ECO is based on the signoff power data generated by update_power command.
  There are three power recovery modes that can be chosen by the user: total power, dynamic power or leakage power.


M-2017.06-SP2
=============
PrimeTime Reference Methodology version M-2017.06-SP2 provides the following
new features, enhancements, and changes:

*  Improved Incremental ECO Flow

   The ECO flow now provides faster incremental extraction, with IC Compiler II
   providing incremental database to StarRC and faster PrimeTime analysis with
   incremental timing update.

*  The All Paths Exhaustive Path-Based Analysis Feature

   The all paths exhaustive path-based analysis algorithm analyzes from the
   complete fanin cone to a violating endpoint for finding the worst path-based
   analysis path. This is a faster algorithm than the traditional exhaustive
   path-based analysis algorithm. You can use this feature by setting the pba_exhaustive_endpoint_path_limit variable to infinity.

*  Estimating ECO Unfixable Reasons

   When you use the -verbose option of the fix_eco_timing or fix_eco_drc command,
   the command reports unfixable violations and its reasons. You can now generate
   the timing ECO "unfixable violation reason" report without performing ECO
   changes, providing guidance on how to address the unfixable violations.

*   Hyperscale Support

   The PrimeTime HyperScale hierarchical analysis method analyzes the block-level
   and top-level portions of the design using separate runs and accurately
   handles the timing interfaces across hierarchical boundaries.

   In the HyperScale flow, the PrimeTime tool creates a context-accurate model
   for each low-level block. This model allows analyzing of each block
   separately, taking into account the constraints and timing characteristics
   of the high-level design. You can also analyze the high-level design
   with an efficient representation of each low-level block that excludes the
   internal logic of the block. The HyperScale technology provides the same
   benefits as interface logic models (ILMs) but with improved accuracy and
   ease-of-use features.

* The Scenario Affinity feature in Distributed Multi-Scenario Analysis (DMSA)

   In DMSA, different scenarios can have different memory requirements. In previous
   releases, you could not direct scenarios to a specified hardware resource.
   The scenario affinity feature allows directing of scenarios to a specific
   hardware resource that are best suited to their requirements. This can improve
   the usage efficiency of compute resources.


M-2016.12
=========
PrimeTime Reference Methodology version M-2016.12 provides the following
new features, enhancements, and changes:

*  Added Advanced Spacing Rules Support

   PrimeTime ADV physically-aware ECO now considers advanced spacing rules to
   minimize displacements and timing degradation during ECO implementation. The
   tool also considers pairwise interlibrary cell rules and advanced
   technology rules exported from the IC Compiler or IC Compiler II tools.

*  Added Automated Clock Mux support

   The automated clock mux constraints feature allows PrimeTime to natively handle
   MUXed clocks. You can avoid creating large number of generated clocks and
   defining exclusivity between the different generated clocks. Clock exclusivity
   is automatically determined and applied between two clocks coming through
   different input pins in the transitive fanout of the clock exclusivity point.
   Set the timing_enable_auto_mux_clock_exclusivity to true to enable auto
   inference of clock MUXes.

*  Added Parametric On-Chip Variation (POCV) Support.

   POCV is an advanced methodology to handle local process variation effects in
   timing analysis. POCV cell variation information can be represented either with
   a single cell-based variation coefficient (side file) or the Liberty Variation
   Format (LVF). The LVF models delay variation for each timing arc at each slew
   and load combination in the library. POCV analysis produces tighter correlation
   between graph-based and path-based analysis. This results in faster timing closure.

*  Added E`xamples For Reduced Resource ECO Design.

   Added examples to write and read reduced resource ECO design in the flow.

*  Added Examples to Use The remove_buffer Method For ECO.

   Added examples to remove buffer for power recovery using the
   fix_eco_power -method remove_buffer command in the ECO flow.

*  ECO Flow Change For The SBPF Format.

   Removed support for SBPF format from the ECO flow.


K-2015.12-SP2
=========
PrimeTime Reference Methodology version K-2015.12-SP2 provides the following
new features, enhancements, and changes:

*  When you select the physical ECO mode, the check_eco command is now used to
   check the physical Library Exchange Format (LEF) and physical Design Exchange
   Format (DEF) files for correctness and consistency with the logical netlist.

*  The New Fix Engineering Change Order (ECO) Noise Feature

   This feature enables noise fixing in both the logical and physical ECO mode.

*  The New timing_ocvm_enable_distance_analysis Variable.

   This variable is set to true when the Advanced On-Chip Variation (AOCV) Mode
   and parasitics have distance location.

*  Starting from this release, the Extracted Timing Model (ETM) contains
   composite current source (CCS) timing data.

   This is possible only if the design libraries contain both CCS timing and noise
   data, and the waveform propagation feature is enabled for analysis by using the
   set delay_calc_waveform_analysis_mode full_design variable.

*  The New Advanced Waveform Propagation (AWP) Feature.

   You can use this feature only if you set the AWP mode option to TRUE in RMgen.
   This feature provides accurate timing analysis for designs with waveform
   distortion in the lower technology nodes. The CCS waveform analysis require
   libraries that contain CCS timing and noise data.

   Note:
      The design libraries must be checked using the check_library command in
	  Library Compiler.

*  The report_noise command is now added to the distributed multi-scenario
   analysis (DMSA) to report noise analysis information. The merged report shows
   the pins with worst slack across all scenarios.

*  The Galaxy Parasitic Database (GPD) support is now added.

   GPD is a compact binary database generated by the StarRC tool. This provides
   benefits such as improved performance, and increased capacity and disk space
   compared to existing parasitic formats.

* The ECO flow is now added to the IC Complier II tool.

   This feature launches IC Compiler II and StarRC as the background tools by
   using the PrimeTime Reference Methodology script to get ECO data and to apply
   ECO change list.

   To run the IC Compiler II ECO flow, copy all the files from the ECO_FLOW/ICCII
   directory into the ECO_FLOW directory, and set up and run the ECO flow,
   similarly as you run the ECO flow with IC Compiler. The new New Data Model
   (NDM) library and blocks are added in the setup file for IC Compiler II.

Reference Methodology version C-2009.06-SP2.

*  Changes have been made to the settings for preexisting options in the RMgen
   graphical user interface (GUI) configuration:

   o  The Analysis Type option has been removed.

   o  The Use Multiple Constraint Files option has been removed and the
      Advanced OCV Mode option has been changed to a primary option.

      Previously, the Advanced OCV Mode option was a secondary option that was
      available only when the Use Multiple Constraint Files option was set to TRUE.

      The script now contains a CONSTRAINT_FILES variable that you can use to list
      all of your constraint files. The USE_MULTIPLE_CONSTRAINTS_FILES and
      SINGLE_CONSTRAINT_FILE variables have been removed from the script.

*  Constraint files can be either Synopsys Design Constraints (SDC) files or
   tool command language (Tcl) files.

   The file type is identified by the file name extension. The PrimeTime Reference
   Methodology now supports both types of constraint files.

*  For Distributed Multi-Scenario Analysis (DMSA) runs, you can now set the
   derating variables by entering numeric values. For example,

   set dmsa_derate_clock_early_value(mode_corner) 1.09
   set dmsa_derate_clock_late_value(mode_corner) 1.09
   set dmsa_derate_data_early_value(mode_corner) 1.09
   set dmsa_derate_data_late_value(mode_corner) 1.09

   In previous versions, the mode and corner had to be embedded in the value. For
   example,

   set dmsa_derate_clock_early_value "mode1_corner1_1.09 mode2_corner1_1.20"


C-2009.06-SP1

   o  The default in the GUI for CRPR_MODE is now POST,  in prior releases
      it was PRE.

   o  The CRPR_THRESHOLD variable has been removed.

   o  The following DERATE variables have been removed:

      1. DERATE_MODE_DERATE_CLOCK
      2. DERATE_MODE_DERATE_DATA
      3. DERATE_MODE_DERATE_EARLY
      4. DERATE_MODE_DERATE_LATE

      The new DERATE variables are:

      1. DERATE_MODE_CLOCK_EARLY
      2. DERATE_MODE_CLOCK_LATE
      3. DERATE_MODE_DATA_EARLY
      4. DERATE_MODE_DATA_LATE

      This produces up to four set_timing_derate statements in the
      generated scripts.

*  Support for PrimeTime PX has been extended to the Distributed Multi-Scenario
   Analysis (DMSA) flow in the RMgen GUI.

   Multicore is supported only in the generic flow,
   PrimeTime does not support multicore in distributed multi-scenario analysis mode
   or in PrimeTime VX.

*  New hierarchical flow supports both the generation and use of hierarchical
   subblocks.

   o  In RMgen GUI for PrimeTime, changed Hierarchical Model to Hierarchical Flow.
      -- The primary options are generation, subblock, or off.
      -- The secondary options are etm, ilm, or both.

   o  Before you can use ILM subblocks in the PrimeTime Reference Methodology,
      you must edit the pt_setup.tcl file.

   Example 1 shows the variables that need to be edited.

   Example 2 shows variables in the common_setup.tcl file, These variables impact

B-2008.12-SP1
=============

This section describes new features, changes, and enhancements in the PrimeTime
Reference Methodology version B-2008.12-SP1.

*  New Distributed Multi-Scenario Analysis (DMSA) flow available within the
   RMgen GUI.

*  New settings for preexisting options within the RMgen GUI configuration:

   o  Flow option settings: PT, PTSI, and PTVX. PTVX is new.

   o  Back Annotation Mode option settings: SBPF, SBPF_VAR, SPEF, SPEF_VAR, and SDF.
      SPEF_VAR and SBPF_VAR are new.

   Based on these additions, the PrimeTime Reference Methodology now has four basic
   flows:

   o  Generic
   o  Distributed Multi-Scenario Analysis (DMSA)
   o  PrimeTime VX
   o  PrimeTime VX with Distributed Multi-Scenario Analysis (PrimeTime VX with DMSA)

   To run in these flows, use the following commands:

   o  Generic
      pt_shell -f pt_scripts/pt.tcl

   o  DMSA
      pt_shell> -multi -f pt_scripts/dmsa.tcl

   o  PrimeTime VX
      pt_shell> -f pt_scripts/ptvx.tcl

   o  PrimeTime VX with DMSA
      pt_shell> -multi -f pt_scripts/ptvx_dmsa_comb.tcl


   The PrimeTime Reference Methodology now comprises the following files:

   o  PT/2008.12-SP1:
      common_setup.tcl
      pt_setup.tcl

   o  PT/2008.12-SP1/pt_scripts:

B-2008.12
=========

This section describes changes in the PrimeTime Reference Methodology
version B-2008.12.

*  The path-based analysis mode for report_timing has been updated for this release.

   o  Set the pba_exhaustive_endpoint_path_limit variable to 100 to limit runtime.

   o  Changed -recalculate to -pba_mode exhaustive within the report_timing command.


B-2008.06
=========

This section describes changes in the PrimeTime Reference Methodology
version B-2008.06.

Note:
   These changes have also been incorporated into versions A-2007.12 and
   A-2007.12-SP1.

--------------------
pt_setup.tcl changes
--------------------

*  Added support for hierarchical flows: Standard Parasitic Exchange Format (SPEF),
   Synopsys Binary Parasitic Format (SBPF), and Standard Delay Format (SDF).
   o  Multiple constraint files--clock, I/O, and timing exceptions--for each flow
   o  Block in the design

*  Added multivoltage libraries.

*  Added an IEEE 1801 (TM) file and variables within the PrimeTime flow.

   IEEE 1801 is also known as Unified Power Format (UPF).

*  Added enhanced support for different derates.

--------------------------
pt_scripts/pt.tcl changes:
--------------------------

*  Added support for hierarchical flows: SPEF, SBPF, and SDF.
   o  Multiple constraint files--clock, I/O, and timing exceptions--for each flow
   o  Block in the design

*  Added support for enhanced reporting mode.
   o  Reporting mode has standard and enhanced modes

*  Renamed PrimeTime Reference Methodology option from Subflow to back annotation
   mode.

*  Improved granularity for timing derates--clock, data, early, and late.

*  Allows you to specify constraints by using either a single constraint file
   or a set of constraint files: CLOCK, I/O, and TE (timing_exception).


A-2007.12
=========

This is the initial release of the GUI-based PrimeTime Reference Methodology.
